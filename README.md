# Description
This website is my work for the first assginment in the Web programming course and it is used HTML to develop. Firstly, when people access to my website, they will see my CV which contains the information about my profile, experience, education, awards and my contact. On the top page will be a navigation bar that help users access to other pages including My CV, Projects, Contact and Blog. Secondly, when users click on the Projects, they will go to the Projects Page and they will see some of my project that I have done with the repository link and the website link hosted on Netlify. Next, when users access to the Contact page, they will see a form and users can type their information. After that, clicking the "Send" button and their input will be saved on that page. Last but not least, when users access the Blog page, they will see the blog which I wrote and if they want to see more, they will have to click on the title of each blog. On some page that users have to scroll down such as CV or Blog, I have added the "Back to top page" link so that users can go to the top of that page instead of scrolling up. Furthermore, each page will contain the navigation bar in order to help users to access to different pages, and the footer which has my Outlook mail and phone number.
